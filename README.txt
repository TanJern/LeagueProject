Purpose of project is to compare the mage champions used by players in two different regions.
NA and EUW are used as examples in code.

Due to API limitations, the sample size of the data is small hence results may be bias.
Data used:
-Top 12 ranked solo players from NA and EUW
-All mage champions that appeared in each players' last 5 games

Please enter your Riot Development API Key before running code.

my_region,player_region,and player_routing can be changed to compare data of other regions.
num_matches_data=5 can be edited to change the number of each players' past game.
